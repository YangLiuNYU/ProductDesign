> There’s a good usability principle right there: if something requires a large investment of time—or looks like it will—it’s less likely to be used.

# Don’t make me think!

"Don’t make me think!”

I’ve been telling people for years that this is my first law of usability. And the more Web pages I look at, the more convinced I become.It means that as far as is humanly possible, when I look at a Web page it should be self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory.I should be able to get it, what it is and how to use it without expending any effort thinking about it.

But when I’m looking at a page that makes me think, all the thought balloons over my head have question marks in them.__When you are creating a site, your job is to get rid of the question marks.__

The point is, when we’re using the Web every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand. The distractions may be slight but they add up, and sometimes it doesn’t take much to throw us.

And as a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things. The fact that the people who built the site didn’t care enough to make things obvious—and easy—can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.

__If you can’t make a page self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.__

# How we really use the web : Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through

Making pages self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better. Using a site that doesn’t make us think about unimportant things feels effortless, whereas puzzling over things that don’t matter to us tends to sap our energy and enthusiasm—and time.

people use the Web, and the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how they actually use them.

When we’re creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading our finely crafted text, figuring out how we’ve organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
What they actually do most of the time (if we’re lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There are usually large parts of the page that they don’t even look at.

If you want to design effective Web pages, though, you have to learn to live with three facts about real-world Web use.

##### FACT OF LIFE #1:We don’t read pages. We scan them.

One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages.1 Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.

The exception, of course, is pages that contain documents like news stories, reports, or product descriptions. But even then, if the document is longer than a few paragraphs, we’re likely to print it out because it’s easier and faster to read on paper than on a screen.

Why do we scan?

* __We’re usually in a hurry.__ Much of our Web use is motivated by the desire to save time. As a result, Web users tend to act like sharks: They have to keep moving, or they’ll die. We just don’t have the time to read any more than necessary.

* __We know we don’t need to read everything.__ On most pages, we’re really only interested in a fraction of what’s on the page. We’re just looking for the bits that match our interests or the task at hand, and the rest of it is irrelevant. Scanning is how we find the relevant bits.

* __We’re good at it.__ We’ve been scanning newspapers, magazines, and books all our lives to find the parts we’re interested in, and we know that it works.

##### FACT OF LIFE #2: We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.

When we’re designing pages, we tend to assume that users will scan the page, consider all of the available options, and choose the best one.

In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best option—we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing.2 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that we’ll click it.

So why don’t Web users look for the best choice?

* __We’re usually in a hurry.__ And as Klein points out, “Optimizing is hard, and it takes a long time. Satisficing is more efficient.”

* __There’s not much of a penalty for guessing wrong.__ Unlike firefighting, the penalty for guessing wrong on a Web site is usually only a click or two of the Back button, making satisficing an effective strategy. Of course, this assumes that pages load quickly; when they don’t, we have to make our choices more carefully—just one of the many reasons why most Web users don’t like slow-loading pages.

* __Weighing options may not improve our chances.__ On poorly designed sites, putting effort into making the best choice doesn’t really help. You’re usually better off going with your first guess and using the Back button if it doesn’t work out.

* __Guessing is more fun.__ It’s less work than weighing options, and if you guess right, it’s faster. And it introduces an element of chance—the pleasant possibility of running into something surprising and good.

##### FACT OF LIFE #3: We don’t figure out how things work. We muddle through.

One of the things that becomes obvious as soon as you do any usability testing— whether you’re testing Web sites, software, or household appliances—is the extent to which people use things all the time without understanding how they work, or with completely wrong-headed ideas about how they work.

Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we’re doing and why it works.

Why does this happen?

* __It’s not important to us.__ For most of us, it doesn’t matter to us whether we understand how things work, as long as we can use them. It’s not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of caring. In the great scheme of things, it’s just not important to us.

* __If we find something that works, we stick to it.__ Once we find something that works—no matter how badly—we tend not to look for a better way. We’ll use a better way if we stumble across one, but we seldom look for one.

And it’s a good question: If people manage to muddle through so much, does it really matter whether they “get it”? The answer is that it matters a great deal because while muddling through may work sometimes, it tends to be inefficient and error-prone.

# Billboard design 101 : designing pages for scanning, not reading

Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are five important things you can do to make sure they see—and understand—as much of your site as possible:

* Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page > Take advantage of conventions  
* Break pages up into clearly defined areas  
* Make it obvious what’s clickable  
* Minimize noise.  

### Create a clear visual hierarchy

One of the best ways to make a page easy to grasp in a hurry is to make sure that the appearance of the things on the page—all of the visual cues—clearly and accurately portray the relationships between the things on the page: which things are related, and which things are part of other things. In other words, each page should have a clear visual hierarchy.

Pages with a clear visual hierarchy have three traits:

* __The more important something is, the more prominent it is.__ For instance, the most important headings are either larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, set off by more white space, or nearer the top of the page—or some combination of the above.

* __Things that are related logically are also related visually.__ For instance, you can show that things are similar by grouping them together under a heading, displaying them in a similar visual style, or putting them all in a clearly defined area.

* __Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what.__ For instance, a section heading (“Computer Books”) would appear above the title of a particular book, visually encompassing the whole content area of the page, because the book is part of the section. And the title in turn would span the elements that describe the book.

We all parse visual hierarchies—online and on paper—every day, but it happens so quickly that the only time we’re even vaguely aware that we’re doing it is when we can’t do it—when the visual cues (or absence of them) force us to think.

A good visual hierarchy saves us work by preprocessing the page for us, organ- izing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

But when a page doesn’t have a clear visual hierarchy—if everything looks equally important, for instance—we’re reduced to the much slower process of scanning the page for revealing words and phrases, and then trying to form our own sense of what’s important and how things are organized. It’s a lot more work.

### Conventions are your friends
At some point in our youth, without ever being taught, we all learned to read a newspaper. Not the words, but the conventions.

We learned, for instance, that a phrase in very large type is usually a headline that summarizes the story underneath it, and that text underneath a picture is either a caption that tells me what it’s a picture of, or—if it’s in very small type—a photo credit that tells me who took the picture.

We learned that knowing the various conventions of page layout and formatting made it easier and faster to scan a newspaper and find the stories we were interested in. And when we started traveling to other cities, we learned that all newspapers used the same conventions (with slight variations), so knowing the conventions made it easy to read any newspaper.

Every publishing medium develops conventions and continues to refine them and develop new ones over time.1 The Web already has a lot of them, mostly derived from newspaper and magazine conventions, and new ones will continue to appear.

All conventions start life as somebody’s bright idea. If the idea works well enough, other sites imitate it and eventually enough people have seen it in enough places that it needs no explanation. This adoption process takes time, but it happens pretty quickly on the Internet, like everything else. For instance, enough people are now familiar with the convention of using a metaphorical shopping cart on e-commerce sites that it’s safe for designers to use a shopping cart icon without labeling it “Shopping cart.”

There are two important things to know about Web conventions:

* __They’re very useful.__ As a rule, conventions only become conventions if they work. Well- applied conventions make it easier for users to go from site to site without expending a lot of effort figuring out how things work.

* __Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.__ Faced with the prospect of using a convention, there’s a great temptation for designers to reinvent the wheel instead, largely because they feel (not incorrectly) that they’ve been hired to do something new and different, and not the same old thing. (Not to mention the fact that praise from peers, awards, and high-profile job offers are rarely based on criteria like “best use of conventions.”)

If you’re not going to use an existing Web convention, you need to be sure that what you’re replacing it with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there’s no learning curve—so it’s as good as a convention, or (b) adds so much value that it’s worth a small learning curve. If you’re going to innovate, you have to understand the value of what you’re replacing, and many designers tend to underestimate just how much value conventions provide. 

__My recommendation: Innovate when you know you have a better idea (and everyone you show it to says “Wow!”), but take advantage of conventions when you don’t.__

### Break up pages into clearly defined areas

Dividing the page into clearly defined areas is important because it allows users to decide quickly which areas of the page to focus on and which areas they can safely ignore. Several of the initial eye-tracking studies of Web page scanning suggest that users decide very quickly which parts of the page are likely to have useful information and then almost never look at the other parts—almost as though they weren’t there.

### Make it obvious what’s clickable

Since a large part of what people are doing on the Web is looking for the next thing to click, it’s important to make it obvious what’s clickable and what’s not.

It’s not a disastrous flaw. I’m sure it didn’t take most users long to just start clicking on things. But when you force users to think about something that should be mindless like what’s clickable, you’re squandering the limited reservoir of patience and goodwill that each user brings to a new site.

### Keep the noise down to a dull roar

One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise. There are really two kinds of noise:

* __Busyness.__ Some Web pages give me the same feeling I get when I’m wading through my letter from Publisher’s Clearing House trying to figure out which sticker I have to attach to the form to enter without accidentally subscribing to any magazines.When everything on the page is clamoring for my attention the effect can be overwhelming: Lots of invitations to buy! Lots of exclamation points and bright colors! A lot of shouting going on!

* __Background noise.__ Some pages are like being at a cocktail party; no one source of noise is loud enough to be distracting by itself, but there are a lot of tiny bits of visual noise that wear us down.

__Users have varying tolerances for complexity and distractions; some people have no problem with busy pages and background noise, but many do. When you’re designing Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to assume that everything is visual noise until proven otherwise.__
