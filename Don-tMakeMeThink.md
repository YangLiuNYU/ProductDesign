> There’s a good usability principle right there: if something requires a large investment of time—or looks like it will—it’s less likely to be used.

# Don’t make me think!

"Don’t make me think!”

I’ve been telling people for years that this is my first law of usability. And the more Web pages I look at, the more convinced I become.It means that as far as is humanly possible, when I look at a Web page it should be self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory.I should be able to get it, what it is and how to use it without expending any effort thinking about it.

But when I’m looking at a page that makes me think, all the thought balloons over my head have question marks in them.__When you are creating a site, your job is to get rid of the question marks.__

The point is, when we’re using the Web every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand. The distractions may be slight but they add up, and sometimes it doesn’t take much to throw us.

And as a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things. The fact that the people who built the site didn’t care enough to make things obvious—and easy—can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.

__If you can’t make a page self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.__

> On the Internet, the competition is always just one click away, so if you frustrate users they’ll head somewhere else.

# How we really use the web : Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through

Making pages self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better. Using a site that doesn’t make us think about unimportant things feels effortless, whereas puzzling over things that don’t matter to us tends to sap our energy and enthusiasm—and time.

people use the Web, and the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how they actually use them.

When we’re creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading our finely crafted text, figuring out how we’ve organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
What they actually do most of the time (if we’re lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There are usually large parts of the page that they don’t even look at.

If you want to design effective Web pages, though, you have to learn to live with three facts about real-world Web use.

##### FACT OF LIFE #1:We don’t read pages. We scan them.

One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages.1 Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.

The exception, of course, is pages that contain documents like news stories, reports, or product descriptions. But even then, if the document is longer than a few paragraphs, we’re likely to print it out because it’s easier and faster to read on paper than on a screen.

Why do we scan?

* __We’re usually in a hurry.__ Much of our Web use is motivated by the desire to save time. As a result, Web users tend to act like sharks: They have to keep moving, or they’ll die. We just don’t have the time to read any more than necessary.

* __We know we don’t need to read everything.__ On most pages, we’re really only interested in a fraction of what’s on the page. We’re just looking for the bits that match our interests or the task at hand, and the rest of it is irrelevant. Scanning is how we find the relevant bits.

* __We’re good at it.__ We’ve been scanning newspapers, magazines, and books all our lives to find the parts we’re interested in, and we know that it works.

##### FACT OF LIFE #2: We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.

When we’re designing pages, we tend to assume that users will scan the page, consider all of the available options, and choose the best one.

In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best option—we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing.2 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that we’ll click it.

So why don’t Web users look for the best choice?

* __We’re usually in a hurry.__ And as Klein points out, “Optimizing is hard, and it takes a long time. Satisficing is more efficient.”

* __There’s not much of a penalty for guessing wrong.__ Unlike firefighting, the penalty for guessing wrong on a Web site is usually only a click or two of the Back button, making satisficing an effective strategy. Of course, this assumes that pages load quickly; when they don’t, we have to make our choices more carefully—just one of the many reasons why most Web users don’t like slow-loading pages.

* __Weighing options may not improve our chances.__ On poorly designed sites, putting effort into making the best choice doesn’t really help. You’re usually better off going with your first guess and using the Back button if it doesn’t work out.

* __Guessing is more fun.__ It’s less work than weighing options, and if you guess right, it’s faster. And it introduces an element of chance—the pleasant possibility of running into something surprising and good.

##### FACT OF LIFE #3: We don’t figure out how things work. We muddle through.

One of the things that becomes obvious as soon as you do any usability testing— whether you’re testing Web sites, software, or household appliances—is the extent to which people use things all the time without understanding how they work, or with completely wrong-headed ideas about how they work.

Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we’re doing and why it works.

Why does this happen?

* __It’s not important to us.__ For most of us, it doesn’t matter to us whether we understand how things work, as long as we can use them. It’s not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of caring. In the great scheme of things, it’s just not important to us.

* __If we find something that works, we stick to it.__ Once we find something that works—no matter how badly—we tend not to look for a better way. We’ll use a better way if we stumble across one, but we seldom look for one.

And it’s a good question: If people manage to muddle through so much, does it really matter whether they “get it”? The answer is that it matters a great deal because while muddling through may work sometimes, it tends to be inefficient and error-prone.

# Billboard design 101 : designing pages for scanning, not reading

Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are five important things you can do to make sure they see—and understand—as much of your site as possible:

* Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page > Take advantage of conventions  
* Break pages up into clearly defined areas  
* Make it obvious what’s clickable  
* Minimize noise.  

### Create a clear visual hierarchy

One of the best ways to make a page easy to grasp in a hurry is to make sure that the appearance of the things on the page—all of the visual cues—clearly and accurately portray the relationships between the things on the page: which things are related, and which things are part of other things. In other words, each page should have a clear visual hierarchy.

Pages with a clear visual hierarchy have three traits:

* __The more important something is, the more prominent it is.__ For instance, the most important headings are either larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, set off by more white space, or nearer the top of the page—or some combination of the above.

* __Things that are related logically are also related visually.__ For instance, you can show that things are similar by grouping them together under a heading, displaying them in a similar visual style, or putting them all in a clearly defined area.

* __Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what.__ For instance, a section heading (“Computer Books”) would appear above the title of a particular book, visually encompassing the whole content area of the page, because the book is part of the section. And the title in turn would span the elements that describe the book.

We all parse visual hierarchies—online and on paper—every day, but it happens so quickly that the only time we’re even vaguely aware that we’re doing it is when we can’t do it—when the visual cues (or absence of them) force us to think.

A good visual hierarchy saves us work by preprocessing the page for us, organ- izing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

But when a page doesn’t have a clear visual hierarchy—if everything looks equally important, for instance—we’re reduced to the much slower process of scanning the page for revealing words and phrases, and then trying to form our own sense of what’s important and how things are organized. It’s a lot more work.

### Conventions are your friends
At some point in our youth, without ever being taught, we all learned to read a newspaper. Not the words, but the conventions.

We learned, for instance, that a phrase in very large type is usually a headline that summarizes the story underneath it, and that text underneath a picture is either a caption that tells me what it’s a picture of, or—if it’s in very small type—a photo credit that tells me who took the picture.

We learned that knowing the various conventions of page layout and formatting made it easier and faster to scan a newspaper and find the stories we were interested in. And when we started traveling to other cities, we learned that all newspapers used the same conventions (with slight variations), so knowing the conventions made it easy to read any newspaper.

Every publishing medium develops conventions and continues to refine them and develop new ones over time.1 The Web already has a lot of them, mostly derived from newspaper and magazine conventions, and new ones will continue to appear.

All conventions start life as somebody’s bright idea. If the idea works well enough, other sites imitate it and eventually enough people have seen it in enough places that it needs no explanation. This adoption process takes time, but it happens pretty quickly on the Internet, like everything else. For instance, enough people are now familiar with the convention of using a metaphorical shopping cart on e-commerce sites that it’s safe for designers to use a shopping cart icon without labeling it “Shopping cart.”

There are two important things to know about Web conventions:

* __They’re very useful.__ As a rule, conventions only become conventions if they work. Well- applied conventions make it easier for users to go from site to site without expending a lot of effort figuring out how things work.

* __Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.__ Faced with the prospect of using a convention, there’s a great temptation for designers to reinvent the wheel instead, largely because they feel (not incorrectly) that they’ve been hired to do something new and different, and not the same old thing. (Not to mention the fact that praise from peers, awards, and high-profile job offers are rarely based on criteria like “best use of conventions.”)

If you’re not going to use an existing Web convention, you need to be sure that what you’re replacing it with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there’s no learning curve—so it’s as good as a convention, or (b) adds so much value that it’s worth a small learning curve. If you’re going to innovate, you have to understand the value of what you’re replacing, and many designers tend to underestimate just how much value conventions provide. 

__My recommendation: Innovate when you know you have a better idea (and everyone you show it to says “Wow!”), but take advantage of conventions when you don’t.__

### Break up pages into clearly defined areas

Dividing the page into clearly defined areas is important because it allows users to decide quickly which areas of the page to focus on and which areas they can safely ignore. Several of the initial eye-tracking studies of Web page scanning suggest that users decide very quickly which parts of the page are likely to have useful information and then almost never look at the other parts—almost as though they weren’t there.

### Make it obvious what’s clickable

Since a large part of what people are doing on the Web is looking for the next thing to click, it’s important to make it obvious what’s clickable and what’s not.

It’s not a disastrous flaw. I’m sure it didn’t take most users long to just start clicking on things. But when you force users to think about something that should be mindless like what’s clickable, you’re squandering the limited reservoir of patience and goodwill that each user brings to a new site.

### Keep the noise down to a dull roar

One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise. There are really two kinds of noise:

* __Busyness.__ Some Web pages give me the same feeling I get when I’m wading through my letter from Publisher’s Clearing House trying to figure out which sticker I have to attach to the form to enter without accidentally subscribing to any magazines.When everything on the page is clamoring for my attention the effect can be overwhelming: Lots of invitations to buy! Lots of exclamation points and bright colors! A lot of shouting going on!

* __Background noise.__ Some pages are like being at a cocktail party; no one source of noise is loud enough to be distracting by itself, but there are a lot of tiny bits of visual noise that wear us down.

__Users have varying tolerances for complexity and distractions; some people have no problem with busy pages and background noise, but many do. When you’re designing Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to assume that everything is visual noise until proven otherwise.__

# Animal, vegetable, or mineral? Why users like mindless choices

On the face of it, “number of clicks to get anywhere” seems like a useful criteria. But over time I’ve come to think that what really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is—the amount of thought required, and the amount of uncertainty about whether I’m making the right choice.

In general, I think it’s safe to say that users don’t mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they’re on the right track—following what Jared Spool calls “the scent of information.” I think the rule of thumb might be something like “three mindless, unambiguous clicks equal one click that requires thought.”

The point is, we face choices all the time on the Web and making the choices mindless is one of the main things that make a site easy to use.

# Chapter 5  Omit needless words : The Art Of Not Writing For The WEB

Of the five or six things that i learned in college, the one that has stuck with me the longest梐nd benefited me the most is E. B. White's seventeenth rule in The Elements of Style: 17. __Omit needless words. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.__

When I look at most Web pages, I’m struck by the fact that most of the words I see are just taking up space, because no one is ever going to read them. And just by being there, all the extra words suggest that you may actually need to read them to understand what’s going on, which often makes pages seem more daunting than they actually are.

My Third Law probably sounds excessive, because it’s meant to. Removing half of the words is actually a realistic goal; I find I have no trouble getting rid of half the words on most Web pages without losing anything of value. But the idea of removing half of what’s left is just my way of trying to encourage people to be ruthless about it.

Getting rid of all those words that no one is going to read has several beneficial effects:

* It reduces the noise level of the page. 
* It makes the useful content more prominent. 
* It makes the pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling.

### Happy talk must die

We all know happy talk when we see it: It’s the introductory text that’s supposed to welcome us to the site and tell us how great it is, or to tell us what we’re about to see in the section we’ve just entered. 

If you’re not sure whether something is happy talk, there’s one sure-fire test: If you listen very closely while you’re reading it, you can actually hear a tiny voice in the back of your head saying, “Blah blah blah blah blah….” 

A lot of happy talk is the kind of self-congratulatory promotional writing that you find in badly written brochures. Unlike good promotional copy, it conveys no useful information, and it focuses on saying how great we are, as opposed to delineating what makes us great.

Although happy talk is sometimes found on Home pages—usually in paragraphs that start with the words “Welcome to…”—its favored habitat is the front pages of the sections of a site (“section fronts”). Since these pages are often just a table of contents with no real content of their own, there’s a temptation to fill them with happy talk. Unfortunately, the effect is as if a book publisher felt obligated to add a paragraph to the table of contents page saying, “This book contains many interesting chapters about _____, _____, and _____. We hope you enjoy them.”

Happy talk is like small talk—content free, basically just a way to be sociable. But most Web users don’t have time for small talk; they want to get right to the beef. You can—and should—eliminate as much happy talk as possible.

### Instructions must die

The other major source of needless words is instructions. The main thing you need to know about instructions is that no one is going to read them—at least not until after repeated attempts at “muddling through” have failed. And even then, if the instructions are wordy, the odds of users finding the information they need is pretty low.

Your objective should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory, or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.

# Chapter 6 Street signs and Breadcrumbs : Designing Navigation

It't a fact: People won't use your Web site if they can't find their way around it.

You know this from your own experience as a Web user. If you go to a site and can’t find what you’re looking for or figure out how the site is organized, you’re not likely to stay long—or come back. So how do you create the proverbial “clear, simple, and consistent” navigation?

### Web Navigation 101

##### You’re usually trying to find something. 

In the “real” world it might be the emergency room or a can of baked beans. On the Web, it might be the cheapest 4-head VCR with Commercial Advance or the name of the actor in Casablanca who played the headwaiter at Rick’s.

##### You decide whether to ask first or browse first. 

The difference is that on a Web site there’s no one standing around who can tell you where things are. The Web equivalent of asking directions is searching—typing a description of what you’re looking for in a search box and getting back a list of links to places where it might be.

Some people (Jakob Nielsen calls them “search-dominant” users)2 will almost always look for a search box as soon as they enter a site. (These may be the same people who look for the nearest clerk as soon as they enter a store.) 

Other people (Nielsen’s “link-dominant” users) will almost always browse first, searching only when they’ve run out of likely links to click or when they have gotten sufficiently frustrated by the site.

For everyone else, the decision whether to start by browsing or searching depends on their current frame of mind, how much of a hurry they're in, and whether the site appears to have decent browsable navigation.

##### If you choose to browse, you make your way through a hierarchy, using signs to guide you. 

Typically, you’ll look around on the Home page for a list of the site’s main sections (like the store’s department signs) and click on the one that seems right. 

Then you’ll choose from the list of subsections.

With any luck, after another click or two you’ll end up with a list of the kind of thing you’re looking for.

Then you can click on the individual links to examine them in detail, the same way you’d take products off the shelf and read the labels.

Eventually, if you can't find what you're looking for, you'll leave. This is as true on a Web site as it is at Sears. You'll leave when you're convinced they haven't got it, or when you're just too frustrated to keep looking.

### The unbearable lightness of browsing

Looking for things on a Web site and looking for them in the “real” world have a lot of similarities. When we’re exploring the Web, in some ways it even feels like we’re moving around in a physical space. Think of the words we use to describe the experience—like “cruising,” “browsing,” and “surfing.” And clicking a link doesn’t “load” or “display” another page—it “takes you to” a page. But the Web experience is missing many of the cues we’ve relied on all our lives to negotiate spaces. Consider these oddities of Web space:

* No sense of scale. Even after we’ve used a Web site extensively, unless it’s a very small site we tend to have very little sense of how big it is (50 pages? 1,000? 17,000?).3 For all we know, there could be huge corners we’ve never explored. Compare this to a magazine, a museum, or a department store, where you always have at least a rough sense of the seen/unseen ratio. The practical result is that it’s very hard to know whether you’ve seen everything of interest in a site, which means it’s hard to know when to stop looking.

* No sense of direction. In a Web site, there's no left and right, no up and down. We may talk about moving up and down, but we mean up and down in the hierarchy -- to a more general or more specific level.

* No sense of location. In physical spaces, as we move around we accumulate knowledge about the space. We develop a sense of where things are and can take shortcuts to get to them.

> Even the people who manage Web sites often have very little idea how big their sites really are.

> This is one reason why it’s useful for links that we’ve already clicked on to display in a different color. It gives us some small sense of how much ground we’ve covered.

When we want to return to something on a Web site, instead of relying on a physical sense of where it is we have to remember where it is in the conceptual hierarchy and retrace our steps. This is one reason why bookmarks—stored personal shortcuts—are so important, and why the Back button accounts for somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of all Web clicks.

It also explains why the concept of Home pages is so important. Home pages are—comparatively—fixed places. When you’re in a site, the Home page is like the North Star. Being able to click Home gives you a fresh start.

This lack of physicality is both good and bad. On the plus side, the sense of weightlessness can be exhilarating, and partly explains why it's so easy to lose track of time on the Web -- The same as when we're lost in a good book.

On the negative side, I think it explains why we use the term “Web navigation” even though we never talk about “department store navigation” or “library navigation.” If you look up navigation in a dictionary, it’s about doing two things: getting from one place to another, and figuring out where you are.

I think we talk about Web navigation because “figuring out where you are” is a much more pervasive problem on the Web than in physical spaces. We’re inherently lost when we’re on the Web, and we can’t peek over the aisles to see where we are. Web navigation compensates for this missing sense of place by embodying the site’s hierarchy, creating a sense of “there.”

### The overlooked purposes of navigation

Two of the purposes of navigation are fairly obvious: to help us find whatever it is we’re looking for, and to tell us where we are. And we’ve just talked about a third:

__It gives us something to hold on to.__ As a rule, it's no fun feeling lost. (Would you rather "feel lost" or "know your way around"? Done right, navigation puts ground under our feet (even if it's virtual ground) and gives us handrails to hold on to - to make us feel grounded.

But navigation has some other equally important—and easily overlooked—functions:

__It tells us what's here.__ By making the hierarchy visible, navigation tells us what the site contains. Navigation reveals content! And revealing the site may be even more important than guiding or situating us.

> Which may be one more reason why slow-loading pages are so bothersome: What’s the fun of flying if you can only go a few miles an hour?

__It tells us how to use the site.__ If the navigation is doing its job, it tells you implicitly where to begin and what your options are. Done correctly, it should be all the instructions you need. (Which is good, since most users will ignore any other instructions anyway.)

__It gives us confidence in the people who built it.__ Every moment we’re in a Web site, we’re keeping a mental running tally: “Do these guys know what they’re doing?” It’s one of the main factors we use in deciding whether to bail out and deciding whether to ever come back. Clear, well-thought-out navigation is one of the best opportunities a site has to create a good impression.

### Web navigation conventions

Physical spaces like cities and buildings (and even information spaces like books and magazines) have their own navigation systems, with conventions that have evolved over time like street signs, page numbers, and chapter titles. The conventions specify (loosely) the appearance and location of the navigation elements so we know what to look for and where to look when we need them. Putting them in a standard place lets us locate them quickly, with a minimum of effort; standardizing their appearance makes it easy to distinguish them from everything else. For instance, we expect to find street signs at street corners, we expect to find them by looking up (not down), and we expect them to look like street signs (horizontal, not vertical). We also take it for granted that the name of a building will be above or next to its front door. In a grocery store, we expect to find signs near the ends of each aisle. In a magazine, we know there will be a table of contents somewhere in the first few pages and page numbers somewhere in the margin of each page—and that they’ll look like a table of contents and page numbers.

Think of how frustrating it is when one of these conventions is broken (when magazines don’t put page numbers on advertising pages, for instance).

### Don’t look now, but I think it’s following us

Web designers use the term persistent navigation (or global navigation) to describe the set of navigation elements that appear on every page of a site.

Done right, persistent navigation should say—preferably in a calm, comforting voice: “The navigation is over here. Some parts will change a little depending on where you are, but it will always be here, and it will always work the same way.”

Just having the navigation appear in the same place on every page with a consistent look gives you instant confirmation that you’re still in the same site— which is more important than you might think. And keeping it the same throughout the site means that (hopefully) you only have to figure out how it works once.

##### Now I know we’re not in Kansas

The Site ID or logo is like the building name for a Web site. At Sears, I really only need to see the name on my way in; once I’m inside, I know I’m still in Sears until I leave. But on the Web—where my primary mode of travel is teleportation—I need to see it on every page.

##### The Sections
The Sections—sometimes called the primary navigation—are the links to the main sections of the site: the top level of the site’s hierarchy. In most cases, the persistent navigation will also include space to display the secondary navigation: the list of subsections in the current section.

##### The Utilities

Utilities are the links to important elements of the site that aren’t really part of the content hierarchy. These are things that either can help me use the site (like Help, a Site Map, or a Shopping Cart) or can provide information about its publisher (like About Us and Contact Us). Like the signs for the facilities in a store, the Utilities list should be slightly less prominent than the Sections.

### A way to search

Given the potential power of searching8 and the number of people who prefer searching to browsing, unless a site is very small and very well organized, every page should have either a search box or a link to a search page. And unless there’s very little reason to search your site, it should be a search box.

Keep in mind that for a large percentage of users their first official act when they reach a new site will be to scan the page for search box. It's a simple formula: a box, a button, and the word "Search". Don't make it hard for them - stick to the formula.

I seldom see a case where the potential payoff for adding options to the persistent search box is worth the cost of making me figure out what the options are and whether I need to use them (i.e., making me think).

If you want to give me the option to scope the search, give it to me when it’s useful—when I get to the search results page and discover that searching everything turned up far too many hits, so I __need__ to limit the scope.

I think one of the primary reasons for Amazon’s success is the robustness of its search. As I mentioned, Amazon was one of the first online bookstores (if not the first) to drop the Title/Author/Keyword option from their search box and just take whatever I threw at them.

I've done several user tests of online bookstores, and left to their own devices, inevitably the first thing people did was search for a book they knew they should be able to find to see if the thing worked. And in test after test, the result was that people抯 first experience of Amazon was a successful search, while in sites that offered options many people were left puzzled when their search failed because they had misinterpreted their options.

And of course, if you’re going to provide options, you need to make sure that they actually work.

### Secondary, tertiary, and whatever comes after tertiary

I think this is one of the most common problems in Web design (especially in larger sites): failing to give the lower-level navigation the same attention as the top. In so many sites, as soon as you get past the second level, the navigation breaks down and becomes ad hoc. The problem is so common that it’s actually hard to find good examples of third-level navigation.

Why does this happen?

Partly, I think, because good multi-level navigation is just plain hard to design— given the limited amount of space on the page, and the number of elements that have to be squeezed in.

Partly because designers usually don't even have enough time to figure out the first two levels.

Partly because it just doesn't seem that important. (After all, how important can it be? It's not primary. It's not even secondary.) And there's a tendency to think that by the time people get that far into the site, they'll understand how it works.

And then there’s the problem of getting sample content and hierarchy examples for lower-level pages. Even if designers ask, they probably won’t get them, because the people responsible for the content usually haven’t thought things through that far, either.

But the reality is that users usually end up spending as much time on lowerlevel pages as they do at the top. And unless you’ve worked out top-to-bottom navigation from the beginning, it’s very hard to graft it on later and come up with something consistent.

Page names are the street signs of the Web. Just as with street signs, when things are going well I may not notice page names at all. But as soon as I start to sense that I may not be headed in the right direction, I need to be able to spot the page name effortlessly so I can get my bearings.

There are four things you need to know about page names:

* __Every page needs a name.__ Just as every corner should have a street sign, every page should have a name.  
* __The name needs to be in the right place.__ In the visual hierarchy of the page, the page name should appear to be framing the content that is unique to this page.  
* __The name needs to be prominent.__ You want the combination of position, size, color, and typeface to make the name say 揟his is the heading for the entire page.?In most cases, it will be the largest text on the page.  
* __The name needs to match what I clicked.__ Even though nobody ever mentions it, every site makes an implicit social contract with its visitors: 	__*The name of the page will match the words I clicked to get there.*__ In other words, if I click on a link or button that says “Hot mashed potatoes,” the site will take me to a page named “Hot mashed potatoes.” It may seem trivial, but it’s actually a crucial agreement. Each time a site violates it, I’m forced to think, even if only for milliseconds, “Why are those two things different?” And if there’s a major discrepancy between the link name and the page name or a lot of minor discrepancies, my trust in the site— and the competence of the people who publish it—will be diminished.

### "You are here"

One of the ways navigation can counteract the Web’s inherent “lost in space” feeling is by showing me where I am in the scheme of things, the same way that a “You are here” indicator does on the map in a shopping mall—or a National Park.

On the Web, this is accomplished by highlighting my current location in whatever navigational bars, lists, or menus appear on the page.

The most common failing of “You are here” indicators is that they’re too subtle. They need to stand out; if they don’t, they lose their value as visual cues and end up just adding more noise to the page. One way to ensure that they stand out is to apply more than one visual distinction—for instance, a different color and bold text.

Too-subtle visual cues are actually a very common problem. Designers love subtle cues, because subtlety is one of the traits of sophisticated design. But Web users are generally in such a hurry that they routinely miss subtle cues.

In general, if you're a designer and you think a visual cue is sticking out like a sore thumb, it probably means you need to make it twice as prominent.

### Breadcrumbs

Like “You are here” indicators, Breadcrumbs show you where you are. (Sometimes they even include the words “You are here.”)

They're called Breadcrumbs because they抮e reminiscent of the trail of crumbs Hansel dropped in the woods so he and Gretel could find their way back home.

Unlike “You are here” indicators, which show you where you are in the context of the site’s hierarchy, Breadcrumbs only show you the path from the Home page to where you are. (One shows you where you are in the overall scheme of things, the other shows you how to get there—kind of like the difference between looking at a road map and looking at a set of turn-by-turn directions. The directions can be very useful, but you can learn more from the map.)

You could argue that bookmarks are more like the fairy tale breadcrumbs, since we drop them as we wander, in anticipation of possibly wanting to retrace our steps someday. Or you could say that visited links (links that have changed color to show that you’ve clicked on them) are more like breadcrumbs since they mark the paths we’ve taken, and if we don’t revisit them soon enough, our browser (like the birds) will swallow them up.

### Four reasons why I love tabs

I think they’re an excellent navigation choice for large sites. Here’s why:

* They’re self-evident. I’ve never seen anyone—no matter how “computer illiterate”—look at a tabbed interface and say, “Hmmm. I wonder what those do?”  
* They’re hard to miss.When I do point-and-click user tests, I’m surprised at how often people can overlook button bars at the top of a Web page.15 But because tabs are so visually distinctive, they’re hard to overlook. And because they’re hard to mistake for anything but navigation, they create the kind of obvious-at-a-glance division you want between navigation and content.  
* They’re slick.Web designers are always struggling to make pages more visually interesting. If done correctly (see below), tabs can add polish and serve a useful purpose.
* They suggest a physical space. Tabs create the illusion that the active tab physically moves to the front.
