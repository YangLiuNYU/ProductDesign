## Don’t makeme think!
Don’t make me think!”
I’ve been telling people for years that this is my first law of usability. And the more Web pages I look at, the more convinced I become.It means that as far as is humanly possible, when I look at a Web page it should be self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory.I should be able to get it, what it is and how to use it without expending any effort thinking about it.

But when I’m looking at a page that makes me think, all the thought balloons over my head have question marks in them.When you抮e creating a site, your job is to get rid of the question marks.
